# Wearable Computing Assignment 01
1. Implement the algorithm described by X. Kang et al in Matlab/Octave, Python, etc.
2. Once the algorithm works in Matlab/Octave, develop an app implementing the
   algorithm either on iOS or Android, or a command line program written in C/C++
   which reads the gyroscope data from a file.

This exercise was implemented in Java.
